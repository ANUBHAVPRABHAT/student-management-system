                For more than six decades, the My School Society has developed with a spirit and a vision.
                Today it stands as a citadel of learning and a harbinger of quality consciousness committed
                to developing the minds and initiatives of children. The vitality of the classrooms, the energy
                of the playing fields, and the open friendliness of the work environment, have enabled My School
                students to reach their fullest potential â€“ whether in securing distinctions in the board examinations
                or winning national/international accolades in drama, debates, or sports. Outstanding board results and
                securing enviable positions in the entrance tests to various professional colleges and institutes of 
                international repute are the accepted identity of a My School school.</p>

                Innovation is fundamental to My School learning programmes and its faculty has endeavored
                to revolutionize in terms of ideas and practices, to match the demands of twenty-first-century
                educational trends and global associations. The primary focus is on meaningful and joyful learning.
                Academias from the country and abroad, meet to exchange and partake of diverse cultural and intellectual 
                experiences.</p>
